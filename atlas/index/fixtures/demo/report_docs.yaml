The team will work these requests in the order listed in the priority column. Directors can view their complete queue and change the priority of their requests .

New reporting content from Epic will be placed in the director request queue for approval and prioritization. This content will be labeled as a ""note"" and will include a link to release note system for review. New reporting content will no longer be released directly.

      Readmission populations match the CMS criteria for 30 day readmissions as closely as possible, but not all the documentation for CMS requirements is available.It is also important to note that a patient may have been an inpatient at another facility at some time.
      NOTE: This methodology differs from that used by  for readmission reporting.
